    <p> I have had many jobs over the years due to moving around and the birth of the my children. I have had to recently change my job direction due to Chronic Obstuctive Pulmonary Disease. The condition does not make myself to be a person who is bad time keeping. I keep on top of my condition and manage it very well. I have worked in retail for many years and feel the lifting of products is something i can not do anymore.
    I know I did not need to mention this on here, but i am an honest person and straight forward and like to be upfront. </p>
     <p> My work experience as follows :-</p>
